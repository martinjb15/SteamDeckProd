## **Planning stage**
### **Target Audiences:**
​
* Users interested in retro gaming
* Users interested in portable gaming

​
### **Color Scheme:**
​
Site overall black background rgb(2, 2, 2); with white wording color: rgb(251, 251, 251);

Section 1 rgb(138, 43, 226);

Section 2 rgb(47, 79, 79);

Section 3 rgb(1, 49, 49);

These color schemes were chosen to to section out the content and make it more visually appealing to the user while keeping max accessability 
​
## **Typography**
* Throughout the page, there are two fonts used:
  * Roboto - On all content  
  * Sans-serif- as a backup if Roboto was no longer available
​
* These were selected as they give a very easy to read font that is inline with tech articles
* All fonts were sourced from Google fonts, as stated in the credits.

​
* Functionality
* * Clicked on every link on the nav bar to make sure it was bringing you to the right sections
* * Checked to make sure that the video was still there in multiple browsers e.g edge, chrome, safari
* * Checked and made sure every picture was loading correctly in multiple browsers 
​
* Validators 
* * HTML Validator <img width="1387" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30955225/194351618-e49a1ecd-6d4a-4598-b25f-8a06e6a250ce.png">
* * CSS Validator <img width="1433" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30955225/194352071-cbdc5a99-f260-4a36-8979-bf1b681dd39d.png">
* * Lighthouse Desktop <img width="1112" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30955225/194344467-d7c8d9b3-593d-43f0-9deb-ce95e14aee69.png">
* * Lighthouse Mobile <img width="1112" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30955225/194344125-35ed44ae-ca70-4dc4-9a7c-9491cfbcaaeb.png">
​
​
## **Bugs**
* The nav bar does overtakes some of the text when clicked in mobile mode- chinging the viewport of the img and changing the rem values of the text links was able to minimise the impact
​
