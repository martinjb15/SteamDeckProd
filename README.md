Planning stage

Target Audiences:
​This section is a breakdown of the target audience 3 or 4 bullet points so using our example​

Users interested in retro gaming
Users interested in portable gaming
Users interested in device tinkering

User Stories:
​User stories are more what the user wants from the site in terms of features and presentation​

As a user, I want to see the subject matter of the page.
As a user, I want to navigate the page to find what I require quickly and easily.
As a user, I want to learn more what the device can offer
As a user, I want to reach out and learn more.

Site Aims:
​This is optional but offers the insight into what the aim of the project are​

To inform the user of the devices operational power 
To inform the user about what the steam deck can offer in portability 
To offer the user an opportunity to get in contact​​ and learn more

Color Scheme:
Site overall black background rgb(2, 2, 2); with white wording color: rgb(251, 251, 251);
Section 1 rgb(138, 43, 226);
Section 2 rgb(47, 79, 79);
Section 3 rgb(1, 49, 49);

These color schemes were chosen to to section out the content and make it more visually appealing to the user while keeping max accessability 

Typography:
Since this site is desinged as a know how and tech information, I used Roboto to keep a nice easy to read and simple design, with sans-serif as a backup.
